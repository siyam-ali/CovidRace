# Welcome to CovidRace!

CovidRace is a locally hosted web app that displays a "racing" bar graph with the countries most impacted by COVID-19
in the early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

CovidRace uses the streamlit and bar-chart-race libraries to create the racing bar graph. It also uses pandas library
for performing operations on the data.

## How to Launch the Project Locally:

1.) Install packages from requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell. You can also 
use your own preferred method.

2.) Open the project in your preferred environment.

3.) If you prefer to use a virtual environment directory to keep this project independent, do so accordingly.

4.) Run the project with "streamlit run main.py" in your environment's terminal. 

5.) A locally hosted webpage should open, displaying the racing bar graph with the specified countries.

6.) In the main.py file you can change the countries in the variable "top_countries" 
to other countries that you would like to see. Please ensure that the countries you add match the **exact spelling** of the
countries in the corona_dataset.csv file.
